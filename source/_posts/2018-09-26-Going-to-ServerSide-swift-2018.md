## The first conference in the world to focus on server-side Swift
We (the Vapor team at Nodes) was excited when we heard that a conference focusing on server-side Swift got announced. We did get the news a bit early since the conference is run by [Tim Condon](https://twitter.com/0xtim), [Martin Lasek](https://twitter.com/martinlasek) and [Steffen D. Sommer](https://twitter.com/steffendsommer) where Martin and Steffen both works at Nodes. Before this conference, we would look at conferences focused around Swift or more traditional "backend" conferences which most likely would focus on another language than Swift. Being able to go to a conference that mixes backend together with our programming language of choice is ideal to us.

The whole Vapor team at Nodes met up in Berlin to participate in the conference and with this blog post we wanted to share a couple of highlights from the conference as well as giving some feedback on the conference in case any readers are considering to go next year.
