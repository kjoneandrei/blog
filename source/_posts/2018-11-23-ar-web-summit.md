It has been two weeks since [Web Summit](https://websummit.com) took place in Lisbon, Portugal and we can still feel the energetic vibes. 3 days full of inspirational speakers, current tech trends, coffee astronauts, robots (have you seen the new social robot Furhat revealed at the summit?), diversity in tech and much more. But out of all, I was personally most excited about the interest that big companies are putting more and more into AR, VR and MR technologies.

Augmented reality still seems to be trivial for some, but when industry leaders like Google,  Porche and AliBaba are heavingly investing in this technology, we know it will soon become a normal thing in our daily lives. There were many tech talks and partner exihibitors that were putting focus on it and here are some highlights:

## Eyes on the road: How AR will change the car industry?

[WayRay](https://wayray.com/)’s Vitaly Ponomarev and Porche AG’s Christian Knörle joined forces to talk about the opportunities and challenges of AR in the car industry. 

WayRay is a Swiss startups that develops holographic AR technologies for connected cars and managed to raise more than 100$M in investments since they launched in 2012. Today the main application is to assist drivers with the navigation, but with the self driving cars of tomorrow, it could extend to much more.

Ponomarev got the idea of the business after an accident he got into because he was distracted by the GPS navigator. This is a great example of how AR can be used for improving our daily lifes, not just for enterainment purposes. He also has a very interesting point of view regarding self-driving cars, in a sense that AR can be a powerful tool to build the trust between passengers and car. By projecting what the car is seeing and thinking, the passenger can understand that the car makes the right decisions. The biggest challenge of WayRay now is to industrialise the technology.

What is interesting about their business plan is that they don’t just develop the hardware and software, they also offer a True AR SDK for 3rd party developers. This brings endless possibilities. WayRay also had a [True AR Challenge hackathon](https://wayray.com/sdk/challenge) at the beginning of the year and it is interesting to look at the projects to get some inspiration and more understanding of this technology.

Christian Knörle compares that adopting AR in our daily lifes would be similar to the experience of getting prescription glasses when you have vision problems. Looking forward to that!

## Magic Leap: from concept to augmented reality

CMO of [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com/) Leap Brenda Freeman gave us more insights on one of the most anticipated piece of technology in the AR world. With 5 cameras in the headset, 3 world cameras that mesh the room and 2 cameras for eye tracking, Magic Leap goes a bit further than augmented reality into mixed reality.

Virtual reality (VR) is a completely immersive vitual experience, augmented reality (AR) overlays virtual objects on the real-work environment, and then there’s mixed reality (MR) which is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.

Those techonologies will have great applications on communication, entertainment, gaming, e-commerce and many more and that is why early adopters are already developing and investing in them. An example of early experimentation is the collaboration between [Magic Leap, H&M and Warpin Media for the new Moschino collection](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/hm-creates-augmented-reality-experience-for-moschino-collab-1202891622/).

Right now their focus is to get developers and creators to build and test everyday use cases on the platform and then later they will also be able to sell the headseat to consumers. They recently had a [developers conference](https://www.magicleap.com/conference) to showcase what is possible with Magic Leap and inspire new ideas.

When asked about the future of those new technologies, 5-10 years down the road, Brenda said:

“We believe this will be the next distruptive computing platform in the generation to come”

“We talk so much about future forward. Future is now! If you aren’t thinking of how to distrupt your respective industry then you’re behind.”

## Our augmented future: What’s next for AR?

Besides those amazing talks we’ve seen artists using AR and VR as a new way of storytelling, startups with new distruptive ideas and partner’s stepping up their exhibition’s game with AR capabilities. A great example was Siemens who used AR to tell employees stories with a new twist.

**Fun fact**: There were **69.304 atendees** which on average walk 13.5 km at Web Summit = 935.604 km. **Together we reached the moon. Twice!**
