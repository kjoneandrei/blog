# Swift Alps

Swift Alps is - as the name might imply - a conference revolving around anything Swift related. As the name also might imply, the conference takes place in the Swiss Alps.

What sets this conference apart from many of the other conferences out there is the format.

Instead of the "traditional", presenter/audience format, Swift Alps focuses on workshops where a mentor runs the workshop and a limited number of participants will pair up and work together learning new material. Each workshop takes 2 hours and you can attend a max number of 3 workshops each day.

This year the topics range from Accessibility to AR kit and reverse engineering to name a few.

2018 is the third year the conference takes place and this year with attendance from Nodes.

Chris and I was attending, and this is a debrief from our Swift adventures in the Swiss Alps.

## Thursday
After waking up to this
![Good morning indeed](https://github.com/nodesagency/blog/blob/feature/swift-alps-2018/source/_posts-images/2018-12-05-swift-alps-2018/goodmorning.png)

It was time to head to the conference to get registered.

After registration, caffeine level adjustments, getting access to the wifi and a brief introduction of their workshop from each of the mentors it was time to get the show rolling, the workshops lined up for Thursday was:

- New generation networking with Swift-NIO by [Florent Pillet](https://twitter.com/fpillet)
- Level Up Your Debugging Skills by [Carola Nitz](https://twitter.com/_Caro_N)
- An "Intents" Guide to Custom Siri Shortcuts by [Alexsander Akers](https://twitter.com/a2)
- Reverse Engineering by [Guilherme Rambo](https://twitter.com/_inside)

and the sad news was that you could only pick three out of these four interesting topics.

## New generation networking with Swift-NIO
I attended the workshop focusing on [Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) (introduced at this years [try! Swift Tokyo](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/tokyo/en/)) and the Network.framework ([introduced by Apple at this years WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/715/)).

The goal was to continue the work started by Florent on either an iOS chat client using Network.framework, or a macOS chat server using Swift NIO, and my session buddy and I chose to start out with the client app.

In my normal, day to day work, networking work is something you set up at the start of a project - typically by coping some code you were satisfied with in a previous project, and then its just there, calling services, translating the returned JSON into model objects that you can use for your "real" work.

Therefore it was really fun and challenging to try and wrap your head around implementing a chat client from scratch. Starting out with making a connection (deciding whether to use TCP or UDP), actually connecting and watch the connection go through different stages before - hopefully - being established, and finally being able to send data over the network.

Apples new [Network.framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network) was pleasant to work with, it felt very swifty with various handler closures and enums with associated values.

An interesting feature in Network.framework is the [NWPath](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpath) and [NWPathMonitor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor) which you can use to monitor the connection and react if it changes...or completely goes away. Super interesting when writing a network monitor for instance.

All in all a very good workshop, good work Florent

## Level Up Your Debugging Skills
I admit it, I like to debug, I actually do! It gives me a good idea about the flow of a program, I can see values of variables in a loop for instance and it is a great tool in my daily work.

While we're at the confessions I'll also admit that my debugging work in Xcode normally resolves to:

- place a breakpoint
- `po interesting object`
- step
- continue

and thats about it. Sure, I had my mind blown by the [Advanced Debugging](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/412/)
video from WWDC 2018 and that also led to one conditional breakpoint in the days after, but that was about it.

So clearly there was potential for levelling up of my debugging skills :)

Carola had made kind of a treasure hunt which introduced you to various features in lldb directly from the terminal. We learned to have the debugger wait for a process to be launched, how to set a breakpoint directly in the terminal, using the repl to execute new code while your "real" code was paused and the final trick, how to update the UI of your app with help from the debugger.

By now lldb veterans may be rolling their eyes over this idiot discovering blatantly obvious things, but it was really interesting for me to be "forced" into using those features. Now I just need to keep integrating the more advanced lldb features into my daily workflow.

Thank you to Carola for a very fine workshop.

## Reverse Engineering
Final course on the menu Thursday was a real treat. An introduction to how to fool around with the private frameworks in the iOS simulator by no other than Guilherme Rambo, amongst many other things writer at [9to5mac](https://9to5mac.com) who [describes him as](https://9to5mac.com/author/guirambobr/)

> a Mac and iOS developer based in Brazil. Known for discovering Appleâ€™s secrets and analyzing leaks

By using the tool [class-dump](http://stevenygard.com/projects/class-dump/) we were able to find intersting ViewControllers in Apples private frameworks and try to instantiate them from our own apps.

The interesting thing was, that for this to really succeed, we had to use good old Objective C, since that allows you to more easily load private frameworks dynamically instead of using the linker. Writing Objective C again was kind of depressing, not because of the language (I really liked Objective C back then), but because you became aware of how rusty you were in that language. Four years ago I was writing Objective C like there was no tomorrow, and now I was fighting the compiler over missing semicolons...how the times have changed :)

We managed to get an example project running that could load the PencilView you normally use in Apples Notes app, it wasn't pretty but really fun.

Later on I managed to get an example working with the FUFlightViewController, and am now able to track our flight back home via Paris :)

This session was great fun and it was interesting to see how you are able to get access to some of the secret frameworks that lies hidden on your simulator

## Friday
